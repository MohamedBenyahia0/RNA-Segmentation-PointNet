**RNA Segmentation with PointNet:**
Developed RNA segmentation model based on PointNet from the paper PointNet : Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation.      

**To save time and allow you to see the results immediately, I have already completed the model training. To directly test the model and visualize the results without retraining, simply upload the checkpoints folder, which contains the final checkpoints, to your Drive. This will allow you to load the pretrained model and proceed directly with testing.**


**Final Valid Segmentation Accuracy : 70.60%**
